# FM pair potential

This project includes all the codes and files for development of classical pair potentials based on force matching to DFT calculations. The examples shown here are silica and silicates, but it can be also applied to other materials as long as pair approximation stands.

Please refer to reference XX for more details. 

Contents 
- data for training the potential (silica, sodium silicate, boron silicate)
- ML codes (regularized linear regression)
- tools for generating discriptors from simulations
